## Service Management

The application supports the following service management actions:

| Action      | Description                 |
|-------------|-----------------------------|
| `install`   | Installs the service.       |
| `start`     | Starts the service.         |
| `stop`      | Stops the running service.  |
| `uninstall` | Removes the installed service. |

### Command Syntax
```bash
redock --action [install|start|stop|uninstall]
```

### Example Commands
- Install the service:
  ```bash
  redock --action install
  ```
- Start the service:
  ```bash
  redock --action start
  ```
- Stop the service:
  ```bash
  redock --action stop
  ```
- Uninstall the service:
  ```bash
  redock --action uninstall
  ```

---

## Building from Source
To build the application locally:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. Build the binary:
   ```bash
   go build -o redock
   ```

3. Move the binary to a location in your `PATH`, such as `/usr/local/bin`:
   ```bash
   mv redock /usr/local/bin/
   ```

---

## Logging
Service logs are printed to the console by default. For advanced logging, redirect output to a file:
```bash
redock > redock.log 2>&1
```

---

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure the application has proper permissions (e.g., run with `sudo` on Linux/macOS).
- Check service status:
  - **Linux/macOS**: `systemctl status redock`
  - **Windows**: Use the Services manager.
